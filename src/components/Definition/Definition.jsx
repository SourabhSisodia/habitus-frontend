        <h1>WHAT IS HABITUS CO-WORKING?</h1>
        <p>
          The definition of co-working is when people assemble in a neutral
          space to effort independently on different projects and the same
          projects. It is different from an office workspace because the people
          in a co-working environment usually are not working for the same
          company. Habitus is an ideal coworking space designed with comfort and
          productivity in mind. Jam-packed with indispensable amenities, Habitus
          CoWorking Space caters to all the requirements of entrepreneurs,
          freelancers, startups, artists and individual content creators.
